If you use Twentyfourteen theme, use both menu locations, and the secondary (left) menu is your main menu, install this plugin.

== Description ==

If you use Twentyfourteen theme, use both menu locations, and the secondary (left) menu is your main menu, install this plugin. The reason: Within Twentyfourteen theme, the horizontal (top) menu is defined as primary menu. Thus, for smaller screens (less than 1008px width) the left menu is moved to the very bottom of the page, reducing the usability of your website, if you use the left menu as the main menu (semantically). This plugin uses jQuery to manipulate the design, keeps the left menu for smaller screen sizes (more than 782px width). Also, it combines both menus for the toggle menu within smartphone layout. One extra feature: If at least one of the menus has more than one level, the plugin adds "menu level" buttons to the mobile toggle menu, according to the number of menu levels used. By default, only one menu level is shown in mobile menu, click the respective level button to show more/less levels of the mobile menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use the plugin in combination with custom styles? =

Yes, it was tested in combination with "Fourteen Colors" and "Styles: Twentyfourteen" plugin. However, as the plugin is still in an early development phase, there might still be minor problems that were not visible during testing.

= What if I use both menus, but the top menu is my primary menu? =

This combination is not yet supported by the plugin. Just contact the plugin author and he'll see what he can do - if you really need it.

= Where can I switch the plugin functionality on and off? =

There is no such option. Once the plugin is activated, the menus are manipulated (see description). To go back to Twentyfourteen defaults, just deactivate the plugin.
